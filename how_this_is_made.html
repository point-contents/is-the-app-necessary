	<h3>The Makefile shows what is happening</h3>
	<p>
		The top of the page contains a blurb, this is created using pandoc to convert blurb.md to html
	</p>
	<p>
		At the bottom of the page there is an index. 
	</p>
	<p>
		This is created with a tree and sed command that creates a tree of the directory and saves this as a html section
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		The python script generate_html creates an html table from products.csv
	</p>
	<p>
		generate_html also contains placeholder html which gives the page its structure.
	</p>
	<p>
		generate_html then uses all of the previously mentioned htmls and stiches them together to make the page that is index.html
	</p>
	<br>

	<b>This is all done using the make command.</b>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Netlify is watching for pushes to the main branch of the respository.
	</p>
	<p>
		If there is a push, Netlify will run the make command publish the directory, serving index.html statically.
